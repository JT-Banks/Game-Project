# Game-Project

## Goal of this project is clean code structure

_This is a project's purpose is to learn, and master code structure so that it optimizes efficency._

The code will be basic, and later implemented on with data structures and potentially algorithms. However, in the early stages this project will be basic. 

__The endgoal is a fully function adventure/rpg game using Jpanels, sounds, tiles, and collisons. This will definitely change with iterations, and scope will be all over the place, but this is primarily a learning experience.__
